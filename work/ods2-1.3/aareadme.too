ODS2 V1.3, 26-SEP-2001

This release of ODS2 has been made by me, working closely with, and
getting approval from, Paul.

It will compile cleanly on OpenVMS Alpha, Windows NT/2000 using
Visual C++ V6.0, Tru64 UNIX V5, and Solaris/Sparc using gcc.

To build on Windows 2000:

   C:> nmake -f makefile.nt

To build on VMS:

   $ mmk
