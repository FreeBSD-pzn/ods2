/*      To set up physical I/O for a new system a group of phyio
        routines need to be set up. They are:-
             phyio_show() which doesn't need to do anything - but
                          it would generally print some statistics
                          about the other phyio calls.
             phyio_init() to prepare a device for use by future
                          read/write calls. The device name would usually
                          map to a local device - for example rra: to /dev/rra
                          on a Unix system. The call needs to return a handle
                          (channel, file handle, reference number...) for
                          future reference, and optionally some device
                          information.
            phyio_read()  will return a specified number of bytes into a
                          buffer from the start of a 512 byte block on the
                          device referred to by the handle.
            phyio_write() will write a number of bytes out to a 512 byte block
                          address on a device.
